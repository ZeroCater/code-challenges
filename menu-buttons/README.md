# Menu Buttons

Create several links, each of which should open a menu containing several
actions.

You can use any library/framework you want, ***except jQuery or Zepto***!

### Objectives

1. Clicking on a link should open the corresponding menu
  - If another menu is open, that menu should close
  - If the corresponding menu is already open, it should close (and not
    re-open)
1. Clicking on a menu action should execute a custom handler, then close the
   menu
1. Clicking outside of an open menu should close the menu
